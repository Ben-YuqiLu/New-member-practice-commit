# New-member-practice-commit

You can either add a file via Graphical User Interface (GUI) or commandline. You may begin with GUI, but you will someday get into commandlines since they offer better control over your repo.

**AND PLEASE DO NOT ADD FILES BY UPLOADING THEM TO GITHUB**

## GUI Instructions

You can use the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) Software or whatever git clients you like (e.g. GitKraken). This doc will use GitHub Desktop for reference.

### Clone this repo

Before cloning, you need to install your GUI client and set up your GitHub account. For GitHub Desktop, simply go to `File > Options > Accounts` and log in to your GitHub account.

Then, visit `File > Clone Repository` to clone this repo. Choose the local path at your preference.

### Create a new branch

Because we have the **never work on the master branch** policy, the first thing one wants to do (and should never forget to) is to create a new branch to host all the commits. **All your edits should be done in a new branch to avoid confusion and conflicts.**

After cloning the repository, you should create a new branch by clicking `Current Branch > New Branch`.

Then, briefly name this new branch as `[your id]/[what you will do]`. in this case, it is `yeshu/add-new-file`.

Do make sure the new branch is based on master branch.

### Add file and commit

In GitHub Desktop, adding and commiting a file is pretty simple:

1. Tick the boxes before the files you'd like to add
2. Write a brief summary (<50 words) for what you've done. You are also recommended to write a longer description for that in the space below.
3. Click commit button

![Add file and commit](pics/github-desktop-add-and-commit.png)

### Push branch

Final steps! Click `publish branches` (or `push origin` if the branch is already published), and your commits are synced to GitHub.com

### Create pull request

For your commits to be merged into `master` branch, you need to create a Pull Request on GitHub.com

Please refer to the [official GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request)

Alternatively, you could just click `Branch > Create Pull Request` in GitHub Desktop, you will be redirected to GitHub.com to continue.

## Command Line Instructions

### Clone this repo (CLI)

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/Computerization/New-member-practice-commit.git
```

### Create a new branch (CLI)

```console
$ git branch yeshu/add-new-file

$ git checkout yeshu/add-new-file
Switched to branch 'yeshu/add-new-file'
```

### Add File (CLI)

Check for current status first

```console
$ git status
On branch yeshu/add-new-file
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        pics/

```

Then add files you would like to commit

```console
$ git add README.md
```

Check your status again

```console
$ git status
On branch yeshu/add-new-file
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        pics/
```

You can confirm that the file(s) added are listed under the `Changes to be committed` section

### Commit (CLI)

```console
$ git commit -m "your commit message (shorter than 50 words)"
```

Alternatively, you could just do `git commit` and use your designated editor to edit commit message. The editor is specified in the `core.editor` setting of git.

For git messages, please refer to the [50/72 format](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2290016/git-commit-messages-50-72-formatting).

Simply put, it's

1. First line being 50 characters or less (equivalent to the "summary" part in GitHub Desktop)
2. Followed by a blank line
3. Remaining texts wrapped at 72 characters (new line after every 72 characters). These lines are equivalent to the "description" part in GitHub Desktop

### Push branch (CLI)

```console
$ git push
```

For first time pushing, you will receive an error message. Simply follow the message.

```console
$ git push
fatal: The current branch yeshu/add-new-file has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin yeshu/add-new-file

$ git push --set-upstream origin yeshu/add-new-file
```

### Create pull request

After pushing, you should setup a pull request. Please refer to the section [Create Pull Request](#create-pull-request).

## VS Code Instructions
Visual Studio Code (henceforth refered to as *VS code*) developed by Microsoft not only is a powerful text editor, but also integrates a viable git manager. Especially ideal to those already VS Code users, the Source Control function allows a one-in-all coding experience.

### Clone this repo (VS Code)

Cloning unfortunately has to be done with the aforementioned two methods. After the repository folder has been set up, simply open it up in a new editor.

Whenever a git project folder is opened (i.e. one with a `.git` folder), Source Control goes to work automatically. 

You may want to synchronize the repo after it's cloned and every once in a while to keep everything up-to-date. The bottom left shows the git status: which branch you are currently working on, and how many commits is `HEAD` behind/ahead of `master`. The "refresh" button will synchronize all changes on the current branch with the remote.

### Create a new branch (VS Code)

Click on the bottom-left button where it now says `Modify-README` (and more likely on your end should say `master`), then select `Create new branch... > [type your branch's name]`. The editor will automatically switch to that branch.

![New Branch](/pics/vscode-new-branch.png)

Here you can also switch to existing branches, in case you need to work on any of them.

### Add file and commit (VS Code)

Source Control would track all file changes as you work in that folder: 

![File Change](/pics/vscode-file-change.png)

The different letters mark their respective statuses: untracked, modified, deleted, etc., and you may also track changes in a specific file.

1. Stage all changes you want to commit with the `+` button next to each file, or click the one next to `Changes` to stage all changes. (Hovering your cursor over any of the buttons can remind you of their purposes.)
2. Type a commit message. 
3. Click the tick `âˆš` at the very top to commit.

### Push branch (VS Code)

The final step to do in VS Code is to click the button next to the branch name, the one with a cloud and an upward arrow. By clicking it, the branch will be published to the remote and can now be seen on the GitHub.com page.

### Create pull request (VS Code)

See instructions in the [above section](#create-pull-request). If you do visit the [GitHub repository page](https://github.com/Computerization/New-member-practice-commit), it should also be self-evident what to do next.

### Invoking terminal

Source Control does little more than packing together a command line workflow. So if you wish, you can still work with CLI inside VS Code by opening up a terminal and typing commands.
